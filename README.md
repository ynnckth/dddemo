# DDDemo
*A demo playground applying some DDD and Clean Architecture concepts*

**TODO**
- [ ] Add a controller and reference unit test using Mock MVC
- [ ] Add an integration test (@SpringBootTest)
- [ ] Try out auto mapping (from adapter to domain, from domain to presenter DTO)
- [ ] Let the ClientService implement a second UC (separate interface)
